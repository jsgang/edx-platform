# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @mollydb to check licensing
#   * One of @e0d, @feanil, @fredsmith, @maxrothman, or @jibsheet
#     to check system requirements

# This must be installed after distribute has been updated.
